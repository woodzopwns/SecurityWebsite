# SecurityWebsite
A website made in PHP designed to teach unknowing people about the dangers of the internet.

This website was designed using a freeware called USB Web Server. This acts as a local server for the purposes of running PHPMyAdmin and Apache. The website is written almost entirely in PHP, which I self taught myself for the purposes of this assignment. We were expected to write in HTML, however I decided that I would go above and beyond for it.
